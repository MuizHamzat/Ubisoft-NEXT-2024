# Ubisoft-NEXT-2025
My submission for the Ubisoft NEXT 2025 competition. Using only C++ and an API from Ubisoft, I made a basic 3D game engine and a game showcasing it. Though I was brand new to developing a game engine, I still feel that for a project that went from late November 2024 to mid Janurary 2025, I was able to learn a lot and make a game that I was proud of.

This year's theme was Mini Golf, and here is the game I made. I mostly learned 3D rendering, ECS, and simple physics and collisions for this project.
