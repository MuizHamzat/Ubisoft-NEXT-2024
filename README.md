# Ubisoft-NEXT-2024
My submission for the Ubisoft NEXT 2024 competition. Using C++ and an API from Ubisoft, I made a game engine and a game showcasing it.

Note: The main folder is labelled API, but everything within the folder isn't from the API. My code is also located in this folder. This will eventually be cleaned up to be more intuitive.
